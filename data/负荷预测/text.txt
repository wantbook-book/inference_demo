Input:  
What anomaly is visible in the voltage time series?


Output:  
<think> 
The time series shows a stable oscillation around nominal voltage (≈1.0 pu) until sample ~650, after which a sudden 5–8% drop occurs with oscillatory recovery. This pattern suggests a transient short circuit or capacitor bank switching event.

Answer:
At time index ≈650, the voltage exhibits a sharp transient dip and subsequent damping oscillation. This indicates a probable fault clearance event or switching surge. The network likely experienced temporary undervoltage propagation along a high-impedance feeder.
