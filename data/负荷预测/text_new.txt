Input：
Please analyze the given time series and predict the next 32 points of active power (p) and reactive power (q) based on the time series

Output：
<think> 
Using  the measured series as training data: - p (active power) gradually increases from 81 to around 89 kW. - q (reactive power) rises from –1.65 kvar to about +0.72 kvar, showing a transition from inductive to slightly capacitive load. Both follow smooth, decaying-oscillation dynamics consistent with mid-voltage feeder evening load growth.

Answer：
Active power p shows a smooth upward convergence toward ≈ 89.9 kW, consistent with late-hour demand rise.Reactive power q transitions from lagging (inductive) to leading (capacitive), implying possible capacitor-bank switching or PV inverter contribution near the forecast horizon.
The 32-step-ahead forecasts are as follows:
Predicted p (kW) = [81.3739, 82.8491, 84.2010, 85.1453, 86.1144, 86.8279, 87.4192, 87.8872, 88.2767, 88.5897, 88.8446, 89.0508, 89.2186, 89.3547, 89.4652, 89.5549, 89.6276, 89.6867, 89.7347, 89.7736, 89.8052, 89.8308, 89.8517, 89.8686, 89.8823, 89.8934, 89.9024, 89.9098, 89.9157, 89.9206, 89.9245, 89.9277]
Predicted q (kvar) = [–1.6507, –1.7786, –1.6334, –1.5145, –1.3506, –1.2677, –1.1683, –1.0755, –0.9678, –0.8715, –0.7772, –0.6882, –0.5986, –0.5116, –0.4265, –0.3443, –0.2639, –0.1856, –0.1091, –0.0347, 0.0379, 0.1086, 0.1776, 0.2448, 0.3103, 0.3742, 0.4364, 0.4971, 0.5562, 0.6138, 0.6700, 0.7248]
